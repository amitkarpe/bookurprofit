But how we can book/sell crypto when we don't have a tool or system, which makes thing simpler.
Do we have Profit and Lose tool for on chain?
Do we have any tool which will follow our wallet on various blockchain and recomend to book profit?
Do we have any tool which will set ratio or percentage for profit and once achieved that threshold automatically it will book the profit?
